# Background and Motivation
The goal is to create a Vercel-compatible Next.js + React web app that allows users to upload up to 10 roof images, preview them, and submit them for analysis. The backend will use OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to assess each image with a custom prompt and return a summarized JSON response. This will serve as a page for a future website. No database or authentication is required.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Handling multiple image uploads (up to 10), previews, and client-side validation.
- Building a user-friendly UI for uploads and previews, including drag-and-drop, copy/paste, and file selection support.
- Implementing a Vercel-compatible API route (`/api/analyze`) for image processing.
- Integrating with OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API (handling file uploads, prompt formatting, and API limits).
- Summarizing and returning results for all images in a single JSON response.
- Ensuring the solution is simple, efficient, and easy to extend.

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Set up Next.js project structure**
   - Success: Project runs locally and on Vercel, with basic home page.
2. **Implement image upload and preview UI**
   - Success: User can select up to 10 images, see previews, and remove images before submitting. UI supports drag-and-drop, copy/paste, and file selection for image input.
3. **Client-side validation for image uploads**
   - Success: User cannot upload more than 10 images; only image files are accepted.
4. **Create `/api/analyze` backend route**
   - Success: Route accepts up to 10 images, returns a JSON response.
5. **Integrate with OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API**
   - Success: Each image is sent to the API with a custom prompt; responses are aggregated and summarized.
6. **Display analysis results to the user**
   - Success: User sees a summary of the analysis after submission.
7. **Testing and Vercel compatibility check**
   - Success: App works locally and after deployment to Vercel.

# Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Task 2 complete: Image upload and preview UI implemented with drag-and-drop, copy/paste, and file selection. User can preview and remove images before submission. Ready to proceed to client-side validation for image uploads.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Proceeding to implement client-side validation for image uploads (max 10 images, only image files).

# Lessons
- None yet. Will be updated as implementation progresses.
